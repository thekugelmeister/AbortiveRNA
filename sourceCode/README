Pipeline:

1. findAbortives
   -locates abortive sequences in a parsed version of the UTR file
    described in the methods section of the paper
   -compiled program outputs a file of abortive matches for both the
    forward and reverse strands

2a. rbsMatch
   -given the output of findAbortives and a file of RBSs, matches
    abortive sequences to RBSs based on location

2b. termParse
   -given the output of findAbortives and a file of terminators,
    matches abortive sequences to RBSs based on location

4. deltaGAnalysis
   -given the output of rbsMatch or termParse, uses the UNAFold
    program hybrid2.pl to evaluate the deltaG of those abortives
   -requires a UNAFold license
